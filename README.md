# IssieBoard
IssieBoard is a configurable extension keyboard application for iOS that helps users with developmental or motor skill disabilities to acquire typing skills. IssieBoard can help people who have visual impairments, learning disabilities, cerebral palsy, and developmental and mental disabilities.

2.	Divide the letters and numbers keys into three sections by row or column and control the colors of each section separately.
3.	Choose which keyboard keys will be visible.
4.	Select the keyboard appearance from a set of pre-configured templates.
5.	Configure a set of special letters and/or numbers, and configure the appearance of this set separately.

### System Requirements

•	iOS 9 or later, using Xcode 7.0 with Swift 2.0.
•	The keyboard implementation in this project is for a Hebrew language keyboard but can be changed to any language easily.


### How to Use IssieBoard 

To install the IssieBoard application on your device or simulator:

1.	Go to Settings → General → Keyboard → Keyboards → Add New Keyboard ...
2.	Add the third-party keyboard called IssieBoard.
